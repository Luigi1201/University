<h1 >Web Typography</h1>
<div>Nº 14. of <a href='/html-and-css'>HTML &amp; CSS Is Hard</a></div>
<div>A friendly tutorial about web fonts and basic typographic principles</div>

<p>“Web typography” refers to the appearance of all the text on
your website. It includes <a
href='/html-and-css/hello-css#more-text-styles'>basic CSS text properties</a>
like what font to use and whether it should be italic or not, but typography
is much more than that. It’s about the space between and around letters,
words, and lines. It’s the size of different runs of text in relation to
one another, and the history behind each font family.</p>

<p>A lot of your typography decisions will come from a designer. The only
problem is that typography is an invisible art. To actually understand what
your designer is asking for, you need to be able to <em>see</em> typography the
same way they do.</p>

<p>This chapter isn’t just about the mechanics of adding web fonts to
your site or the CSS properties to move your text around. We’ll also
explain how to properly leverage all these tools to make beautiful,
professional websites. By the end of the chapter, you should not only
know what your designer is talking about when they say something like,
“Can we increase the leading of that paragraph?”, but also
understand <em>why</em> they want you to increase it.</p>

<p>You may forget the specific CSS properties, but the typographic concepts
we’re going to cover will stay with you for the rest of your life because
they aren’t arbitrary rules&mdash;they’re grounded in function.
They make your content more readable and help you communicate your message more
effectively.</p>



<h2><span>A Brief History of Web Fonts</span></h2>

<p>We’re going to start this chapter by learning how to display your web
pages in a custom font because that’s the most exciting aspect of modern
web typography. However, web fonts have changed a lot over the last few years,
so before we can start building out our example, we need a little primer on the
various font formats floating around the Internet.</p>

<h3>Web Safe Fonts</h3>

<p>Long, long ago, web developers only had “web safe fonts” at
their disposal. These were a collection of a dozen or so fonts that were
pre-installed on most computers. There was no such thing as a custom font file
that you could send to browsers to use on your website.</p>

<p>If you <em>needed</em> a special font, your only option was to export an
image of the text you wanted to display and include it in your web page with an
<code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> element. This was ridiculously limiting for web
designers and resulted in some pretty hacky situations for developers.
Honestly, we don’t know how everybody survived through that era of HTML
and CSS.</p>


<h3>Custom Web Fonts</h3>

<p>Around 2010, browsers began supporting custom web fonts, which was great,
except for the fact that each browser and device required a different file
format. Accordingly, most websites provided 4 different web font files:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>File Format</th>
      <th>Browser/Device</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code>.svg</code></td>
      <td>Very old Safari (iOS and Desktop)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>.eot</code></td>
      <td>Internet Explorer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>.ttf</code></td>
      <td>Everything except Internet Explorer</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>.woff</code></td>
      <td>Newer browsers</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This resulted in the <a target='_blank'
  href='https://www.paulirish.com/2009/bulletproof-font-face-implementation-syntax/'>“Bulletproof
  <code>@font-face</code> syntax”</a>, which you’ll likely
encounter at some point in your web development career.</p>



<div><h3>WOFF Fonts</h3></div>

<p>Recently, the industry has standardized on the Web Open Font Format (WOFF),
so things have gotten a little bit simpler for us. <a target='_blank'
href='http://caniuse.com/#search=woff'>Over 90%</a> of modern browsers support
<code>.woff</code> fonts, and support for its next evolution,
<code>.woff2</code>, is growing. WOFF2 is similar to the original WOFF format,
but offers a significant reduction in file size (which means better
performance).</p>

<p>Eventually, you’ll only need to support WOFF2, but right now, we
suggest providing both WOFF and WOFF2 web fonts to get decent coverage for
older browsers and improved performance on modern ones. Unless legacy browsers
make up a large chunk of your target audience, <code>.ttf</code>,
<code>.svg</code>, and <code>.eot</code> fonts are a thing of the past.</p>


<h2 ><span>Where to Find Web Fonts</span></h2>

<p>There’s a ton of places on the web where you can download both free
and premium web fonts, but our three favorites are listed below. Again, which
font to use is usually up to your designer (and their budget), but as a
developer, it’s still good to know the trade-offs between these
options.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Website</th>
      <th>Price</th>
      <th>Quality</th>
      <th>Selection</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><a href='https://www.fontsquirrel.com/'>Font Squirrel</a></td>
      <td>Free</td>
      <td>Hit-or-Miss</td>
      <td>Huge</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href='https://fonts.google.com/'>Google Fonts</a></td>
      <td>Free</td>
      <td>Good</td>
      <td>Decent</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><a href='https://www.fontspring.com/'>Fontspring</a></td>
      <td>Expensive</td>
      <td>Excellent</td>
      <td>Huge</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Note that Font Squirrel and Fontspring offer both web fonts and desktop
fonts (<code>.otf</code> and <code>.ttf</code> files). WOFF is designed
specifically for the needs of the modern web, while desktop fonts contain extra
functionality useful for graphics editing programs like Adobe Illustrator. Be
sure to download or purchase the web font version of the fonts you want to
use&mdash;not just the desktop version.</p>
